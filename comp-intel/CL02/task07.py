"""
You are given a list of lists containing two numbers that will need to be color coded later based on a trend determined by the following rules:
1. If the first number of a row is higher than the second number of the previous row, append the string `up` to the row
2. If the first number of a row is lower than the second number of the previous row, append the string `down` to the row
3. Otherwise, append `same` to the row.

Obviously you cannot apply these rules to the first row (there is no preceding row), so append an empty string for the first row.

Basically think of this as a list of Open/Close values, and we want to assign the values `same`, `up`, or `down` based on how a row's Open value compares to the Close of the *previous* row.

For example, given the following list:
data = [
    [10, 20],
    [20, 30],
    [35, 50],
    [45, 60]
]
Then after your code finishes running, your `data` should look like this:
[
    [10, 20, ''],
    [20, 30, 'same'],
    [35, 50, 'up'],
    [45, 60, 'down']
]
"""

data = [
    [10, 20],
    [20, 30],
    [35, 50],
    [45, 60]
]
for i in range(1, len(data)):
    for j in range(0, len(data[i])):
        if data[i][j] > data[i - 1][j + 1]:
            data[i].append('up')
        elif data[i][j] < data[i - 1][j + 1]:
            data[i].append('down')
        else:
            data[i].append('same')
        break
for row in data:
    print(row)
